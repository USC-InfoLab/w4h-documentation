## Prerequisites
1. In order to install W4H on your server, it is highly recommended to use Docker. This approach helps avoid potential issues related to software version mismatches and environment configurations. Ensure that Docker is running on your server, then execute the following command in your terminal:
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USC-InfoLab/w4h-integrated-toolkit/jize/docker-compose.yml && docker-compose up --build

2. To set your own database, ensure you have your database service in somewhere, and you know the
db's host,username,password,database name, and the port it is listening to.
