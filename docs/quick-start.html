<p>The W4H Toolkit provides an ecosystem of tools to manage and analyze wearable and other EHR data. We have created a Docker container to give you an overview of what’s included in the toolkit.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-container">Starting the Container</h2>
<p>You will need to install the <code>Docker Engine</code> by following the instructions to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Install Docker Engine</a> for your platform.</p>
<p>Once that is done start and type <code>uscimsc/w4h</code> in the search bar and select the <code>preview</code> tagged image. After pulling to download the image, run the container by clicking on the “run” icon under “Actions” next to the image name.</p>
