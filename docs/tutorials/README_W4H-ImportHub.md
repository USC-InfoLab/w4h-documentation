## Prerequisites

Before you embark on your journey with W4H ImportHub, please ensure:

- Python 3.x is your trusted companion.
- Essential dependencies are in your toolkit (Check the [Installation](#installation)).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USC-InfoLab/W4H-ImportHub.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd W4H-ImportHub
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Setup Configuration:** Before diving into the import process, ensure your environment is set up correctly (see [Installation](#installation)). Copy the `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`. Within this configuration file, input your database connection details. You can either leverage our default recommended platform configuration or customize it to better match your specific requirements.

2. **Launch the Streamlit app:** Run the W4H ImportHub Streamlit dashboard:
    ```bash
    streamlit run import_hub_main.py
    ```
This will provide an address which you can use to access the UI in your web browser.

3. **Database Instance Decision:** Once on the UI, you'll have the option to either populate an existing W4H database instance or initiate a new one.

4. **CSV Integration:** Upload the CSV file you intend to incorporate into the W4H platform.

5. **Mapping Configuration:** After finishing the upload, the tool will intelligently suggest a default mapping grounded in the similarity between the CSV column names and the W4H table names. At this stage, review and, if needed, adjust the mapping using the intuitive UI dashboard.

6. **Populate the W4H Database:** With the mapping set, confirm the import process. The tool will then swing into action, meticulously populating the W4H database according to your directives.

By following these steps, you can easily bridge the gap between your offline datasets and the expansive world of the W4H platform.
