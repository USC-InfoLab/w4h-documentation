# StreamSim: Real-Time Data Streaming Simulator

StreamSim is a real-time data streaming simulator tool that allows researchers and developers to simulate real-time streaming behavior for tabular data. It provides a convenient way to test real-time applications when the actual real-time data source is not yet available or when simulating different scenarios for testing purposes.

## Documentation

For detailed instructions on how to use the functions and modules provided by StreamSim, please refer to the [StreamSim Documentation](https://nih-w4h.github.io/StreamSim/).


## Features

- Simulates real-time streaming behavior for tabular data.
- Supports stream simulation from a database table or a CSV file.
- Customizable data processing and simulation logic.
- Easy configuration.


## Prerequisites

Before using StreamSim, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (see Installation section)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NIH-W4H/StreamSim.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Configure the application settings in the `conf.py` file. Specify the database connection details, dataset path, timeout interval, and other relevant parameters.

2. Implement the desired data processing logic in the `process_stream()` function in the `stream_sim.py` file. Customize it to suit your specific requirements.

3. Start the Flask server to enable stream simulation:

   ```bash
   python stream_sim.py
   ```

4. In a separate terminal, run the ingest_stream.py script to periodically fetch streams from the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python ingest_stream.py
    ```

5. Observe the simulated stream data and verify that it meets your expectations.
