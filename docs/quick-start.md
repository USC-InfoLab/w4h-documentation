# Quick Start

The W4H Toolkit provides an ecosystem of tools to manage and analyze wearable and other EHR data. We have created a Docker container to give you an overview of what's included in the toolkit. To get started, you must install the `Docker Engine` by following the instructions to [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your platform. There are two ways to start the container:

- Using the command line
- Using Docker Desktop GUI

## Starting the Container Using the Command Line

This option is the preferred...

## Starting the Container Using Docker Desktop

Once that is done start and type `uscimsc/w4h` in the search bar and select  the `preview` tagged image. After pulling to download the image, run the container by clicking on the “run” icon under “Actions” next to the image name.
