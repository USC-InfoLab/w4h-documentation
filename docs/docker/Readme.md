# Docker Getting Started Guide

## Installation

Docker is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows. Install the appropriate version of Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Installing the Image in Docker Desktop

1. Start the Docker Desktop application.
2. In Docker Desktop, search for `uscimsc/w4h` and select the preview-tagged image.
3. Click "pull" to download the image.

## Starting the Container

### Running the Container from Docker Desktop

When you load an image into memory, it becomes a running container. To run a container in Docker Desktop:Click on the "run" icon under "Actions" next to the image name.

Click on "Optional Settings" and fill in the form as follows:

Finally, click the "Run" button to start the container.

### Running the Container from the Command Line as a Background Process

Alternatively, you can run a Docker image from the CLI, which is the preferred method for running Docker images.

**NOTE:** To use the Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) you may need to add `$HOME/.docker/bin` to your PATH (see note under Settings > Advanced in docker desktop).

When you start the container for the first time, docker will “pull” the image from Docker Hub and place a copy on your system. 

To start the container as a background process, execute:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=admin -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e hostname=db -dp 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 --name w4h uscimsc/w4h:preview
```

### Running the Container from the Command Line in Verbose Mode

To start the container in verbose mode, execute in a terminal:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=admin -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e hostname=db -p 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 --name w4h uscimsc/w4h:preview
```
The following is the truncated output:
```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_DB=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e hostname=db -p 8501:8501 uscimsc/w4h:sample
